^ ### Therapy is portrayed as a process
^ Defined inputs, defined outputs
^ Turn the cogs and out pops the result
^ You're not doing work, it just _happens_

^ it's _people_
^ it's a wall of Japanese gachapon machines
^ Random inputs, unexpected outputs
^ You never get the same toy twice

# Agile

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

^ 2001
^ 17 developers, all dudes
^ This was their top declaration
^ Emphasis theirs

# Programming is _people_

### What people heard

### Programming, circa 2005

- I have a problem
- XP
- All my problems are solved!

---

### Which, we know how that works

- The practices that worked for one set of people at Chrysler will never work for your set of people at your company

---

### And we've certainly learned that lesson by now

### Programming, circa 2020

- I have a problem
- Kubernetes
- All my problems are solved!

---

### Feelings over Hype

Because we're all random inputs and unexpected outputs
What worked for [insert company here] may not work for you
Your problems are different
Your team is different
Your solutions will be different
If a solution doesn't feel right, don't use it.

### What pain does X solve

---

### Do I feel that pain?

---

### What does their solution require?

---

### Do I have those tools?

---

### Revisit, Iterate, Abandon
